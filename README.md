# The programmer QWERTY layout (WIP)

The aim of this layout is to take stress of the ring finger and pinky and move
it to the middle and index fingers.

Layout is constructed with special focus on `vim` shortcuts and `regex`
patterns. Also, some of the frequently together used symbols are aimed to be
near each other, e.g., pointer related symbols `*`/`&`, or `#`/`!`. 

There might be some speed benefits with other layouts but QWERTY is fast
enough. The main problem is that there's too many symbols to be handled with the
right hand's ring finger and pinky.
